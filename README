This is a plugin for the Xfce panel, version 4.12 or higher.
It displays at all times how many users are currently logged in, issues
a desktop notification when a user logs in and subsequently when one
logs out.

It was mostly developed on a PowerBook5,4 running Void Linux PPC.

Settings

The Critical Number of Users sets the threshold starting at which critical
notifications are shown.
The Alarm Period (in seconds) defines how often usermon should check utmp

History
=======

The current usermon is a Xfce port of a previous version targeting
Jonas Aaberg's General Applet Interface library [1], developed in
2003 and 2005 and never subsequently published.
